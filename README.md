### Hi there 👋
<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Intrepidd&count_private=true&theme=dark" />
I'm Adrien, a developer specialized in Ruby & Javascript.

I try to make the world a tad better with code. 

After helping sharing cars 🚗 @ [Drivy/Getaround](https://fr.getaround.com) for 4 years, I'm now CTO @ [Écotable](https://ecotable.fr/) 🍽

I like writing simple code, starting small and iterating.
